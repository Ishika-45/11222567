üß©System Design Document ‚Äì URL Shortener Web App
Candidate: Ishika Bansal
Evaluation Type: Frontend (React)
Time Limit: 2 Hours
Hosting Environment: http://localhost:3000
______________________________________
1. üéØObjective
Create a responsive and scalable client-side URL Shortener Web App with React where the user can shorten URLs, optionally create custom shortcodes and expiry dates, and monitor usage analytics such as click history and source. The application should make use of logging middleware and store data locally.
______________________________________
2. Architectural Overview
‚Ä¢	Frontend Architecture:Component-based design with React Functional Components and Hooks
‚Ä¢	Modular directory structure (components/, pages/, utils/, middleware/)
‚Ä¢	Routing:React Router v6 for SPA navigation
‚Ä¢	Routes: / (Home - shorten URLs), /stats (Analytics), /:shortCode (Redirector)
‚Ä¢	Persistence:All data in localStorage (client-side persistence)
‚Ä¢	Redirection Logic: Client-side route /:shortCode initiates redirection if valid and not expired
‚Ä¢	Traces and updates analytics on every click using updateClicks
‚Ä¢	Theming & Styling: Material UI with dynamic light/dark mode switch
‚Ä¢	Responsive layouts with Grid and Box components
________________________________________
3. Key Components
Component	Responsibility
URLForm.jsx	Form to shorten up to 5 URLs with validation
Stats.jsx	Displays click stats, location (via Geolocation API), etc.
Redirector.jsx	Handles URL redirection, logging, and click tracking
Navbar.jsx	Navigation bar with theme toggle
URLCard.jsx	Displays shortened URLs with copy option
________________________________________
4. Data Modelling
Shortened URL Object:
{
  longUrl: string,
  shortCode: string,
  createdAt: string (ISO),
  expiry: string (ISO),
  clicks: [
    {
      timestamp: string,
source: string,
location: string (or coordinates)
}
]}

Stored as array in localStorage under key: "shortenedURLs"

5. ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Choices & Justifications
Technology	Purpose & Justification
React.js	Single-page app with dynamic state, rapid rendering, ease of maintenance
Material UI	Modernity, accessibility, responsiveness in UI components
localStoragePersistent data between sessions on client
React Router v6	Client-side navigation without the page reload
Geolocation API	Captures location of user click data
Custom Logging Middleware
Replaces console.log for systematic audit-style logging
UUID / Random Generator
Generates unique shortcodes programmatically
__________________________________
6. Client-Side Logging Strategy
‚Ä¢	Custom middleware logs each user action (Shorten URL, Click, Redirect, etc.)
‚Ä¢	Saved in localStorage as "logs" for session-spanning traceability
‚Ä¢	Has timestamp and metadata
‚Ä¢	Console logging is disabled according to instructions
__________________________________
7. ‚úÖ Validation & Error Handling
Input Field	Validation Applied
Long URL	Must be valid HTTP/HTTPS URI
Validity (min)	Must be an integer (default = 30 min if unspecified)
Custom Shortcode
Must be unique and alphanumeric
‚Ä¢	Inline errors indicated using TextField helperText and error props
‚Ä¢	Invalid/expired links redirect to homepage with logging
________________________________________
8. Assumptions Made
‚Ä¢	Users are pre-authenticated; no authentication required
‚Ä¢	All redirection and data retrieval done client-side only
‚Ä¢	no backend/database; storage and analytics handled through localStorage
‚Ä¢	uniqueness of Shortcode enforced through loop and in-memory check
________________________________________
9. Scalability Considerations (Future Scope)
‚Ä¢	Migrate storage from localStorage to a backend with a DB (e.g., MongoDB/PostgreSQL)
‚Ä¢	‚Ä¢Implement user authentication for personalized URL management
‚Ä¢	‚Ä¢Implement rate-limiting & bot detection
‚Ä¢	‚Ä¢Implement IP-based Geo API for precise location tracking
‚Ä¢	‚Ä¢Implement QR code generation for mobile sharing
‚Ä¢	‚Ä¢Host on cloud with real hosting (Vercel, Firebase, Vultr, etc.)
________________________________________
10. Testing & Dev Notes
‚Ä¢	Component unit testing can be implemented through Jest
‚Ä¢	Manual testing was performed for:
‚Ä¢	URL shortening
‚Ä¢	Redirection
‚Ä¢	Expiry handling
‚Ä¢	Statistics tracking
‚Ä¢	Responsive layout on desktop & mobile
‚Ä¢	Light/Dark theme toggle

‚úÖ Conclusion
This front-end application is user-centered, maintainable, and modular. All of the essential features ‚Äî analytics, logging, routing, validation, and data handling ‚Äî are handled neatly on the client side according to the constraints of the problem.
